# Calibration Data Collection Configuration

# Robot connection
robot:
  ip: "192.168.0.29"
  port: 1502

# Position stability thresholds
thresholds:
  position_mm: 0.5 # Maximum position difference in mm
  rotation_deg: 0.1 # Maximum rotation difference in degrees

# Chessboard settings
chessboard:
  # Number of squares (NOT internal corners!)
  # For example: 11x8 board has 11 squares wide, 8 squares tall
  squares: [11, 8]       # Number of squares (width, height)
  square_size_mm: 22     # Size of each square in mm

  # Internal corners will be calculated automatically as [squares[0]-1, squares[1]-1]
  # 11x8 squares = 10x7 internal corners

# Data storage
storage:
  images_dir: "calibration_data/images"
  data_file: "calibration_data/calibration_data.yaml"
